### **Seminar: Differences Between Fund Flow and Cash Flow Statements**

This seminar focuses on two crucial financial analysis tools that, while often confused, serve distinct purposes. Understanding their differences is key to a comprehensive financial assessment.

#### **1. Meaning & Concept**

*   **Fund Flow Statement:**
    *   **Meaning:** It reveals the **changes in a company's working capital** (current assets minus current liabilities) between two balance sheet dates. It explains the sources from which funds were received and the uses to which these funds were applied during a specific period.
    *   **Focus:** Movement of **Long-Term Funds** (i.e., changes in non-current assets and non-current liabilities). It answers: "Where did the long-term money come from, and how was it invested?"

*   **Cash Flow Statement:**
    *   **Meaning:** It provides a detailed account of the **inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents** during a period. It tracks the actual movement of cash from operating, investing, and financing activities.
    *   **Focus:** **Liquidity** and short-term financial health. It answers: "How did the company's cash balance change, and why?"

#### **2. Basis of Preparation**

*   **Fund Flow:** Based on **accrual accounting**. It considers non-cash items like depreciation and accounts for changes in working capital.
*   **Cash Flow:** Based on **cash accounting**. It records only transactions that result in an actual inflow or outflow of cash.

#### **3. Purpose & Objective**

*   **Fund Flow:**
    *   To analyze the **long-term financial strategy** of a company.
    *   To identify how money was raised (e.g., issuing shares, long-term debt) and how it was used (e.g., buying fixed assets, paying off long-term debt).
    *   To assess changes in the company's working capital position.

*   **Cash Flow:**
    *   To assess the company's **ability to generate cash** to meet its immediate obligations (liquidity).
    *   To determine the short-term viability of a firm, especially its ability to pay bills.
    *   To provide a clear picture of a company's cash-generating efficiency from its core operations.

#### **4. Key Differences (Summary Table)**

| Basis of Difference        | Fund Flow Statement                                      | Cash Flow Statement                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meaning**                | Shows changes in financial position (working capital)    | Shows changes in the cash position                            |
| **Basis of Accounting**    | Accrual Basis                                            | Cash Basis                                                    |
| **Discloses**              | Sources and uses of funds (long-term)                    | Inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents             |
| **Purpose**                | Long-term financial planning and analysis                | Short-term liquidity and cash management assessment           |
| **Component of Change**    | Working Capital                                          | Cash                                                          |
| **Status**                 | **Not mandatory** under accounting standards (e.g., IFRS, Ind AS) | **Mandatory** for most companies as per accounting standards  |
| **Starting Point**         | Usually, the profit as per the income statement          | Net Profit (adjusted for non-cash transactions)               |
| **Part of Financials?**    | Historically used, but largely replaced by the Cash Flow Statement | One of the three core financial statements (with P&L and Balance Sheet) |

#### **5. Which is More Important?**
Today, the **Cash Flow Statement is considered more critical** for most stakeholders (investors, creditors) because it is harder to manipulate and directly addresses a company's survival riskâ€”the ability to have enough cash on hand. The Fund Flow Statement is now more of an analytical tool for internal management for long-range planning.

### **Assignment: Meaning, Objectives, and Types of Financial Statement Analysis**

#### **1. Meaning of Financial Statement Analysis**
Financial Statement Analysis (FSA) is the process of **critically examining and interpreting the financial information** contained in a company's financial statements (primarily the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement). It involves applying analytical tools and techniques to evaluate:
*   The company's **profitability, solvency, liquidity, stability, and growth potential**.
*   The **relationship between various financial data points** to make informed economic decisions.

In essence, it transforms raw financial data into meaningful information for decision-making.

#### **2. Objectives of Financial Statement Analysis**
The primary objective is to aid various users in making informed judgments and decisions. Specific objectives include:

*   **To Assess Profitability:** To determine the company's ability to generate earnings and the efficiency of its operations. Key for investors and owners.
*   **To Judge Solvency:** To evaluate the company's long-term financial stability and its ability to meet its **long-term obligations**. Crucial for debenture holders and financial institutions.
*   **To Determine Liquidity:** To assess the firm's short-term financial strength and its ability to pay off its **short-term debts** as they come due. Vital for suppliers and short-term creditors.
*   **To Analyze Operational Efficiency:** To understand how effectively the company is utilizing its assets to generate revenue and profit. Used extensively by management.
*   **To Forecast Future Performance:** To identify trends and use past performance to make reasonable predictions about the company's future prospects.
*   **To Facilitate Comparative Analysis:** To compare the firm's performance with that of its competitors (cross-sectional analysis) and its own performance over time (time-series analysis).
*   **To Make Investment & Credit Decisions:** To provide a basis for investors to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell securities, and for creditors to decide on creditworthiness and lending terms.

#### **3. Types of Financial Statement Analysis**
Financial statement analysis can be classified on several bases:

**A. On the Basis of Material Used:**
1.  **External Analysis:** Conducted by outsiders who do not have access to the company's internal records (e.g., investors, creditors, government agencies). They rely solely on published financial statements.
2.  **Internal Analysis:** Performed by the company's own internal management and accountants. They have access to detailed internal cost and accounting records, allowing for a more in-depth and confidential analysis.

**B. On the Basis of Modus Operandi (Method of Operation):**
1.  **Horizontal Analysis (Trend Analysis):** Compares financial data over a series of reporting periods (e.g., over 5 years). It identifies growth patterns, trends, and changes over time. Line items are presented side-by-side and the change (both absolute and percentage) is calculated.
2.  **Vertical Analysis (Common-Size Analysis):** Involves studying the relationship of different items within a **single financial statement** for one period. Each line item is expressed as a percentage of a significant total (e.g., all items on the Income Statement as a % of Revenue; all items on the Balance Sheet as a % of Total Assets). This allows for easy comparison of companies of different sizes.
3.  **Ratio Analysis:** The most powerful and common tool. It involves calculating meaningful ratios from financial statements to evaluate various aspects like profitability (e.g., Net Profit Margin, ROE), liquidity (e.g., Current Ratio, Quick Ratio), solvency (e.g., Debt-to-Equity Ratio), and efficiency (e.g., Inventory Turnover).

**C. On the Basis of Objectives Sought:**
This classification aligns with the objectives of different users.
1.  **Short-Term Analysis (Liquidity Analysis):** Focuses on the short-term financial position and the firm's ability to meet working capital needs.
2.  **Long-Term Analysis (Solvency Analysis):** Focuses on the long-term profitability and capital structure of the firm.
3.  **Credit Analysis:** Performed by creditors to judge the safety of their debt and the borrowing entity's ability to repay.
4.  **Security (Investment) Analysis:** Conducted by investors to determine the attractiveness and potential return of an investment in a company's equity or debt.

By employing these types of analysis, stakeholders can peel back the layers of financial data to gain a true understanding of a company's financial health and trajectory.
