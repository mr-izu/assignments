## **1. Introduction**

Financial management involves making sound decisions regarding investments that maximize shareholder wealth. One of the most widely used techniques for capital budgeting is the **Profitability Index (PI) Method**. The PI helps businesses evaluate and rank investment projects based on their relative profitability. It is particularly useful when firms face **capital rationing**, where they must choose the best combination of projects due to limited funds.

## **2. Meaning of Profitability Index (PI)**

The **Profitability Index** (also called the **Benefit-Cost Ratio**) is a **capital budgeting technique** that measures the present value of future cash inflows generated by a project relative to its initial investment.

* It shows how many rupees (or dollars) of value are created per rupee invested.
* A PI greater than 1 indicates that the project is profitable, while a PI less than 1 indicates a loss-making project.

---

## **3. Formula of PI**

$$
PI = \frac{\text{Present Value of Future Cash Inflows}}{\text{Initial Investment}}
$$

* If **PI > 1** → Accept the project.
* If **PI = 1** → Break-even (neutral decision).
* If **PI < 1** → Reject the project.

---

## **4. Steps in Calculating PI**

1. Estimate the future cash inflows from the project.
2. Discount the cash inflows to their present value using the required rate of return (or cost of capital).
3. Sum up all discounted cash inflows.
4. Divide the total present value of inflows by the initial investment.

## **5. Decision Rule in PI Method**

* **Independent Projects:** Accept all projects with PI > 1.
* **Mutually Exclusive Projects:** Choose the project with the highest PI.
* **Capital Rationing:** Rank projects according to PI and select the best combination until funds are exhausted.

---

## **6. Advantages of PI Method**

* Considers the **time value of money**.
* Helps in **ranking projects** when capital is limited.
* Easy to understand and apply.
* Aligns with the goal of **maximizing shareholder wealth**.

---

## **7. Limitations of PI Method**

* Requires accurate estimation of **future cash flows**.
* Depends on the **discount rate**, which may be difficult to determine.
* May lead to conflicts with **Net Present Value (NPV)** method in the case of mutually exclusive projects.
* Not always suitable for comparing projects with different scales of investment.

---

## **8. Example of PI Calculation**

**Case:**

* Initial Investment = ₹100,000
* Present Value of Future Cash Inflows = ₹130,000

$$
PI = \frac{130,000}{100,000} = 1.3
$$

✅ Since PI > 1, the project is **accepted** because it generates ₹1.30 for every ₹1.00 invested.

---

## **9. Conclusion**

The Profitability Index (PI) method is a valuable financial tool for evaluating investment projects. It incorporates the time value of money, provides a clear decision rule, and is highly effective in capital rationing situations. However, managers must use it carefully, as it depends heavily on accurate cash flow forecasts and discount rates. When combined with other capital budgeting methods such as NPV and IRR, PI becomes a powerful guide for making optimal investment decisions.
