## **Introduction**

A research report is a formal presentation of the findings of a study or investigation. It is a systematic and well-organized document that communicates the purpose, process, and results of research in a clear and concise manner. The report may be presented in the form of a **dissertation** or **thesis**, depending on the nature and purpose of the study.

Every research report follows a specific format that ensures clarity, consistency, and professionalism. Generally, the **mechanical format** of a research report consists of three main parts:

1. **The Preliminaries**
2. **The Text**
3. **The Reference Materials**

## **1. The Preliminaries**

The preliminary section includes the formal and introductory parts of the research report. These help the reader understand the topic, structure, and authenticity of the research. The preliminaries are usually arranged in the following order:

1. **Title Page** – Displays the title of the research, the name of the researcher, institution, guide, and date of submission.
2. **Letter of Transmittal** – A formal letter through which the researcher submits the report to the concerned authority.
3. **Acknowledgement** – A section where the researcher expresses gratitude to those who supported the research.
4. **Letter of Authentication** – A certificate from the supervisor or institution confirming that the research is original and authentic.
5. **Table of Contents** – Lists the chapters, sections, and sub-sections along with page numbers.
6. **List of Tables** – Contains the titles and page numbers of all tables included in the report.
7. **List of Figures or Illustrations** – Lists all figures, charts, or diagrams used in the report for visual support.

## **2. The Text**

The **text** forms the main body of the research report and presents the core content of the study. It is usually divided into six key sections:

1. **Abstract** – A concise summary of the research problem, objectives, methods, results, and conclusions.
2. **Introduction** – Provides background information, defines the problem, and states the purpose and objectives of the study.
3. **Research Procedure** – Describes the research design, sampling methods, tools, data collection techniques, and analytical methods used.
4. **Results** – Presents the findings of the study, often supported by tables, charts, or graphs.
5. **Discussions** – Interprets the results, explains their implications, and compares them with previous studies.
6. **Conclusion and Summary** – Summarizes the major findings, draws conclusions, and may offer recommendations for future research.

## **3. The Reference Materials**

The final part of the research report includes all supporting materials and additional information. It allows readers to verify sources and understand supplementary data.

1. **Bibliography** – A list of all books, journals, articles, websites, and other sources referred to in the research.
2. **Appendix/Appendices** – Includes additional documents, questionnaires, raw data, or calculations that are relevant but not included in the main text.
3. **Index (if any)** – Provides an alphabetical list of important terms or topics with corresponding page numbers for easy reference.

## **Conclusion**

A well-structured research report not only presents findings but also reflects the researcher’s systematic approach and analytical skills. Following a standard format ensures that the report is professional, easy to read, and academically credible. The three major components—**Preliminaries, Text, and Reference Materials**—together form the foundation of an effective research presentation.
