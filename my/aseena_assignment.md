## **Introduction**

A research report is a systematic and well-organized presentation of a study’s findings. It communicates the purpose, methods, and results in a clear manner. Research reports usually follow a standard format consisting of three main parts:

1. **The Preliminaries**
2. **The Text**
3. **The Reference Materials**
