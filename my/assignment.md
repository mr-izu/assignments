# Comparison of Traditional and Modern Approaches in Flow Analysis

## Introduction

Flow analysis is a technique used in financial management and accounting to study the movement of funds within an organization. It helps in understanding how resources are generated, utilized, and distributed across different activities. Over time, flow analysis has evolved from traditional methods—focused mainly on fund flow and cash flow statements—to modern approaches that incorporate advanced analytics, real-time reporting, and broader financial as well as non-financial factors.
