## **2. Historical Background**

The origin of the Indian banking system dates back to the late 18th century, with the establishment of the **Bank of Hindustan (1770)** and later, the **State Bank of India’s** predecessor — the **Bank of Calcutta (1806)**.
Post-independence, the sector underwent major reforms, including the **nationalization of banks in 1969 and 1980**, which brought a large portion of banking under government control to ensure inclusive growth. In the 1990s, the **liberalization era** introduced private and foreign banks, promoting competition and innovation.
