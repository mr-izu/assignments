## **1. Financial Analysis**
**Financial Analysis** is the process of evaluating businesses, projects, budgets, and other finance-related entities to determine their performance and suitability. It involves:
- Using financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement)
- Applying analytical tools (ratios, trend analysis, common-size statements)
- Assessing profitability, liquidity, solvency, and efficiency
- Helping stakeholders make informed economic decisions

## **2. CVP Analysis**
**Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis** examines how changes in costs (fixed and variable), sales volume, and price affect a company's profit. Key elements:
- **Fixed Costs**: Remain constant regardless of output
- **Variable Costs**: Change with production volume
- **Sales Price**: Revenue per unit sold
- **Break-even Point**: Where total revenue equals total costs
- **Margin of Safety**: Excess of actual sales over break-even sales

Uses: Profit planning, pricing decisions, determining optimal product mix.

## **3. Management Accounting**
**Definition**: Management Accounting is the process of identifying, measuring, analyzing, and communicating financial information to managers for achieving organizational goals.

### **Nature**:
1. **Future-oriented**: Focuses on forecasting and planning
2. **Internal Use**: For management decision-making
3. **Flexible**: No fixed format or accounting standards
4. **Multidisciplinary**: Includes economics, statistics, operations research
5. **Confidential**: Internal reports not publicly disclosed

### **Scope**:
1. **Financial Accounting**: Providing historical data
2. **Cost Accounting**: Cost ascertainment and control
3. **Budgetary Control**: Planning and controlling operations
4. **Inventory Control**: Managing stock levels
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Using quantitative methods
6. **Tax Planning**: Minimizing tax liability
7. **Internal Audit**: Ensuring policy compliance
8. **Reporting**: Timely information to management

## **4. PV Ratio (Profit-Volume Ratio)**
**P/V Ratio** expresses the relationship between contribution and sales:
\[
\text{P/V Ratio} = \frac{\text{Contribution}}{\text{Sales}} \times 100
\]
Where Contribution = Sales - Variable Costs

**Significance**:
- Measures profitability
- Helps in break-even analysis
- Useful for decision-making (product mix, pricing)

---

## **5. Common Size Statements**
**Common Size Statements** are financial statements where each line item is expressed as a percentage of a base figure:
- **Balance Sheet**: Each item as % of total assets/liabilities
- **Income Statement**: Each item as % of net sales

**Purpose**:
- Facilitates comparison across companies and periods
- Identifies trends and structural changes
- Simplifies analysis of financial statements

## **7. Marginal Cost**
**Marginal Cost** is the additional cost incurred to produce one more unit of output.
\[
\text{Marginal Cost} = \text{Change in Total Cost} รท \text{Change in Quantity}
\]
It primarily includes variable costs (materials, labor, etc.) that change with production volume.

---

## **8. Break-even Point (BEP)**
**Break-even Point** is the level of sales where total revenue equals total costs (no profit, no loss).

**Formulas**:
- **BEP (units)** = Fixed Costs รท Contribution per unit
- **BEP (sales)** = Fixed Costs รท P/V Ratio

**Significance**: Helps in determining the minimum sales needed to avoid losses.

---

## **9. Contribution**
**Contribution** is the amount remaining from sales revenue after deducting variable costs.
\[
\text{Contribution} = \text{Sales} - \text{Variable Costs}
\]
**Uses**:
- Covers fixed costs first
- Remaining contribution becomes profit
- Key for break-even and margin of safety calculations
