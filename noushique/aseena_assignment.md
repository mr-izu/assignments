## **Importance of Organisation**

Before writing a research report, proper planning and structuring are crucial. Organising ideas in a logical sequence helps maintain focus and avoid unnecessary repetition or wrong emphasis. A well-structured report not only improves readability but also ensures smooth communication of research results.

The report, as a whole and in each of its parts, should have **unity, uniformity, and continuity**, ensuring that all sections are connected and flow logically from one to another.

## **Forms of Organisation**

The organisation of a research report forms its foundation. It can generally be of three types:

* **Horizontal Organisation:** Based on topics and subtopics that are interrelated, suitable for research on current issues.
* **Sequential Organisation:** Follows a chronological order, showing development or progress over time.
* **Mixed Organisation:** Combines both horizontal and sequential forms, depending on the nature and purpose of the study.

## **Conclusion**

The organisation of a research report is a vital prerequisite for effective presentation of research findings. A clear and logical structure ensures better communication, readability, and understanding of the study. Thus, careful planning and systematic arrangement are key to preparing a well-organised research report.
