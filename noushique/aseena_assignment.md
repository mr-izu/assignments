## **Introduction**

A research report is a formal and structured presentation of the outcomes of a research study. It communicates the purpose, methods, findings, and conclusions of the research in a clear and systematic manner. The way a report is organised plays a crucial role in determining how effectively the information is conveyed to the reader.

A well-organised report not only reflects the researcherâ€™s understanding of the subject but also ensures clarity, coherence, and logical flow. Therefore, understanding the **organisation or structure** of a research report is essential for presenting research findings in a professional and meaningful way.

## **Organisation of a Research Report**

The organisation or structure of a research report refers to the systematic arrangement of its various parts in a logical and sequential manner after data collection and analysis. Proper organisation enables the researcher to present ideas clearly and effectively.

A well-planned structure ensures **unity, uniformity, and continuity** throughout the report. It helps in avoiding unnecessary repetition and wrong emphasis, making the presentation clear and understandable. Each section of the report should be logically connected to the next, maintaining a smooth flow of information.

## **Forms of Organisation**

The organisation or plan of a research report can generally be of three types:

* **Horizontal Organisation:**
  Based on interrelated topics and subtopics. Suitable for studies dealing with current issues.

* **Sequential Organisation:**
  Arranged in chronological order, showing development or progress of the research over time.

* **Mixed Organisation:**
  A combination of horizontal and sequential forms. Adopted depending on the research problem, purpose, and available time.

## **Conclusion**

The organisation of a research report is an essential prerequisite for presenting research findings effectively. A clear and logical structure improves communication, readability, and overall understanding. Proper planning and systematic arrangement are key to preparing a well-organised research report.
