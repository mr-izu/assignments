## **Organisation of a Research Report**

The organisation or structure of a research report is the process of arranging the parts of the report in a logical and sequential manner after data collection and analysis. Proper organisation helps the researcher present ideas clearly and effectively.

A well-planned structure ensures unity, uniformity, and continuity throughout the report. It prevents repetition, avoids wrong emphasis, and ensures that each part of the report connects smoothly with the others. Organisation serves as the foundation of the research report and plays an important role in effective communication of research findings.

## **Forms of Organisation**

The structure or plan of a research report can generally take three forms:

* **Horizontal Organisation:**
  Based on topics and subtopics that are interrelated. It is most suitable for research on current problems.

* **Sequential Organisation:**
  Follows a chronological order, showing the development or progress of the study over time.

* **Mixed Organisation:**
  A combination of both horizontal and sequential forms. It is chosen depending on the nature and purpose of the study, the research problem, and the time available.

## **Conclusion**

The organisation of a research report is essential for presenting research findings in a clear, logical, and systematic manner. A properly structured report improves understanding, readability, and overall presentation. Careful organisation ensures effective communication of research results.
