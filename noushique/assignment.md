# Importance of Consistency and Transparency in Financial Statements

## Introduction

Financial statements are the backbone of corporate reporting. They provide information about a company’s financial performance, position, and cash flows to stakeholders, including investors, creditors, regulators, and management. For financial statements to be useful, they must adhere to certain qualitative characteristics—two of the most critical being **consistency** and **transparency**. These principles ensure that financial data is reliable, comparable, and trustworthy for decision-making.

## Meaning of Consistency and Transparency

### Consistency

* Refers to the continuous application of accounting principles, policies, and methods over time.
* Ensures comparability of financial information across different accounting periods.
* Example: If a company uses the straight-line method of depreciation, it should continue using the same method in future periods unless a justified change is disclosed.

### Transparency

* Implies clear, accurate, and complete disclosure of financial information.
* Ensures that stakeholders understand the true financial position without manipulation or concealment.
* Example: Disclosing contingent liabilities, related-party transactions, or changes in accounting estimates.
