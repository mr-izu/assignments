# Liquidity Ratios: Types and Importance in Financial Decision Making

## Introduction

Liquidity ratios are essential financial metrics used to measure a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations without raising external capital. They assess the ease with which assets can be converted into cash to cover current liabilities. Strong liquidity ensures that a firm can smoothly manage its operations, while poor liquidity may lead to financial distress.

## Types of Liquidity Ratios

1. **Current Ratio**

   * **Formula:**

     $$
     \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
     $$
   * **Meaning:** Indicates whether the company has enough short-term assets to cover short-term liabilities.
   * **Interpretation:** A ratio of 2:1 is considered healthy in most industries.

2. **Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**

   * **Formula:**

     $$
     \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets – Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
     $$
   * **Meaning:** Measures the company’s ability to pay short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets (excluding inventory).
   * **Interpretation:** A ratio close to 1:1 is generally acceptable.

3. **Cash Ratio**

   * **Formula:**

     $$
     \text{Cash Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash + Cash Equivalents}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
     $$
   * **Meaning:** Shows the firm’s ability to meet short-term obligations using only cash and cash equivalents.
   * **Interpretation:** This is the most conservative liquidity measure.

4. **Operating Cash Flow Ratio**

   * **Formula:**

     $$
     \text{Operating Cash Flow Ratio} = \frac{\text{Operating Cash Flow}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
     $$
   * **Meaning:** Assesses the firm’s ability to cover current liabilities using cash generated from operations.
   * **Interpretation:** A higher ratio reflects stronger operational liquidity.
