# Cash Flow Statement as a Tool for Short-Term Decision Making

## Introduction

The cash flow statement is one of the three core financial statements, alongside the income statement and balance sheet. Unlike profit, which may include non-cash items, the cash flow statement focuses on actual inflows and outflows of cash during a given period. For managers, investors, and creditors, this statement serves as a critical tool for analyzing liquidity, solvency, and operational efficiency. In particular, it plays an important role in **short-term decision making**, where the availability of cash determines whether a business can sustain its day-to-day operations.
