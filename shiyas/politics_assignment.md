### **Introduction**

Grassroots democracy forms the foundation of a participatory political system. In India, **Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)** serve as the cornerstone of local self-governance, empowering rural communities to participate in decision-making and development activities. Through decentralization of power, PRIs aim to make democracy more inclusive, transparent, and accountable at the village level.
